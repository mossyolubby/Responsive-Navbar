           <h1>About Me</h1>
           <p>I hold a second class upper bachelor’s degree in Accounting from Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH) where I developed my technology-related training in various management, computer, statistics and engineering courses. I joined Skye Bank, Visafone Telecommunications and lately LAW Travels delivering excellent customer service from cradle to becoming a manager of both human and efficient customer experience projects.
            In my quest to challenge myself and solve bigger problems, I enrolled in software development training with Alabian Solutions during the COVID-19 lockdown in May 2020 where I trained in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and NOdeJS. I took a step further to resign my appointment and joined Skillgrid Technologies as an intern developing in-depth expertise in JavaScript application in building a web project, sample of which will be made available.
            Albeit I am working hard to up-skill my development experience, I have great work ethics, good attitude, loyal and a wonderful team playing skills desirable on any team. Other soft skills include my willingness and ability to learn fast, proficient communication, good customer experience and ability to manage project to meet budget, schedule and stakeholders expectation.   
            I welcome the opportunity to join the team as a Junior Software Developer to accomplish project objectives of the organization, managing clients and their journey through every project while growing to become a Project Manager who puts the interest of all stakeholders at the forefront. This will increase revenue and make satisfied and loyal clients.
